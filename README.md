# CV-Project 
## Prediction Model Analysis
This project acts as a pipeline to perform certain image transformations as a method to preprocess images, and feeding those transformed images though CNN models. Depending on the input classes, different features will be extracted, and a good predictive model can be determined for the usecase. 

Three transforms are used in this project : 
+ Fast Fourier Transform
+ Daubechies Transform
+ Haar Wavelet Transform
+ Canny Edge Detection
